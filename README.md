Working through some of [Dan Gusfield](http://csiflabs.cs.ucdavis.edu/~gusfield/)'s 
[Algorithms on Strings, Trees and Sequences](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Strings-Trees-Sequences-Computational/dp/0521585198) with the primary goal of implementing a performant, generalized suffix tree.

There are many useful applications of suffix trees. I was first motivated by the problem of finding the longest common substring of a set of strings, as presented on [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/lcsm/) 

Suffix Tree goals:

- [X] longest common substring of a set of strings
- [ ] linear time construction with Ukkonen's algorithm
- [ ] linear time construction with Weiner's algorithm
- [ ] convert to suffix array
